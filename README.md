# 🧮 Simple Calculator Console App

A beginner-friendly C# console application that performs basic arithmetic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This calculator handles user input interactively and gracefully prevents division by zero.

---

## 📌 Features

- Supports four core arithmetic operations:
  - ➕ Addition
  - ➖ Subtraction
  - ✖️ Multiplication
  - ➗ Division (with zero-check)
- Interactive and user-friendly interface
- Graceful exit option
- Console color-coding for improved readability

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Prompts the user to enter two numbers.
2. Accepts an operation character (`a`, `s`, `m`, or any other key for division).
3. Displays the result of the selected operation.
4. Asks the user whether they’d like to perform another calculation or exit.

## 💬 Sample Interaction

```

Hello, Welcome to the calculator program!
//////////////////////////////////////////
